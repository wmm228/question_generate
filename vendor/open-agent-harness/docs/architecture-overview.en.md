# Architecture Overview

## 1. What This Is

Open Agent Harness is a headless agent runtime. It exposes capabilities through OpenAPI + SSE and keeps the official client surfaces focused on WebUI, TUI, and Desktop. WebUI and TUI in this repository both connect to the same API to operate and observe workspace, session, run, and storage state; Desktop should follow the same API / profile contract.

The product hierarchy is infrastructure-style:

| Abbrev | Name | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OAR` | Open Agent Runtime | Developer-facing runtime package layer: publishable, reusable runtime bundles for initializing workspaces. |
| `OAS` | Open Agent Spec | User-facing spec layer: user-added configuration and imported resources layered on top of an OAR/runtime baseline, such as `AGENTS.md`, `.openharness/memory/MEMORY.md`, imported `tool` / `skill` / `model` entries. |
| `OAH` | Open Agent Harness | Enterprise/platform deployment for Compose, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, object storage, sandbox fleets, and multiple workers. |
| `OAP` | Open Agent Harness Personal | Personal deployment for a local daemon, SQLite, local disk, embedded worker, and single-user workflows. |

Both `OAH` and `OAP` should expose the same OAH-compatible API. WebUI, TUI, and Desktop are clients; they are not bound to one deployment shape. Desktop is not OAP-specific. It only enables local daemon supervisor behavior when connected to OAP:

```text
WebUI     ┐
TUI       ├── OAH API ── OAH enterprise server
Desktop   ┘          └── OAP local daemon
```

OAR and OAS have a baseline-plus-overlay relationship, not two unrelated input streams. OAR provides the publishable runtime baseline. OAS is what a user adds or overrides at the workspace level. The service layer loads the result as an effective workspace:

    Api --> Personal
    Enterprise --> Engine
    Personal --> Engine
    Runtime -->|"initializes workspace"| Workspace
    Spec -->|"extends / overrides"| Workspace
    Workspace -->|"loaded by"| Engine
```

The key difference between the personal and enterprise editions should live in the deployment profile, storage backend, worker / sandbox shape, and default directories, not in the protocol or client contract.

After connecting to any OAH-compatible API, clients should first read a server profile such as `GET /api/v1/system/profile`. The server must report whether it is `edition=enterprise` or `edition=personal`, along with capabilities such as local daemon control, local workspace paths, and model management. WebUI, TUI, and Desktop should enable behavior from profile / capabilities, not from URL, port, or localhost guesses.

Two types of users:

- **Platform developers** -- define agents, actions, skills, tools, hooks
- **Consumers** -- open a workspace and collaborate with agents to execute tasks

Two workspace kinds:

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `project` | Full workspace with tools, execution, and local runtime state |
| `workspace` | Unified workspace; loads prompts, agents, models, actions, skills, tools, and hooks |

## 2. Design Principles

- **Workspace First** -- The platform provides the runtime; the workspace declares capabilities. All project-level capabilities live in the workspace, except model credentials.
- **Session Serial, System Parallel** -- Runs are serial within a session; sessions run concurrently; intra-run tool parallelism is agent-policy-controlled.
- **Domain Separate, Invocation Unified** -- action / skill / tool / native tool stay separate in domain, config, and governance; unified as tool calling for the LLM.
- **Local First, Sandbox Ready** -- Default local execution; execution layer is replaceable from day one; future support for containers / VMs / remote runners.
- **Identity Externalized** -- No built-in user system; consumes external identity and access context.
- **Auditable by Default** -- All runs, tool calls, action runs, and hook runs produce structured records.
- **Central Truth, Local Runtime State** -- PostgreSQL is the central source of truth; workspace `history.db` only stores local runtime data and is not a cross-process sync path.
- **Embedded by Default, Controlled in Production** -- The smallest deployment uses `oah-api` with an embedded worker; production uses a split `oah-api + oah-controller + oah-sandbox` topology.

## 3. Formal Terms

### Agent Engine / Agent Runtime / Agent Spec

- `Agent Engine`: the execution, scheduling, recovery, audit, and API exposure system
- `Agent Runtime`: the primary runnable unit, formerly called `blueprint`
- `Agent Spec`: the user-authored extension layer on top of a runtime / workspace baseline, mainly `AGENTS.md`, `.openharness/memory/MEMORY.md`, and extra loaded `model` / `tool` / `skill`
- mnemonic: `Engine` is how it runs, `Runtime` is what runs, `Spec` is what the user adds

### API Server

- The unified external entry point for OAH
- Owns OpenAPI, SSE, caller context, auth integration, metadata persistence, and owner routing
- Can run with an embedded worker or in `api-only` mode

### Worker

- The unified execution runtime role in OAH
- Owns run execution, session-serial boundaries, the tool loop, workspace file access, workspace materialization, and flush / evict
- `Worker` is a responsibility, not a deployment shape

### Controller

- The control-plane role in OAH
- Owns workspace placement, owner affinity, capacity, drain, recovery, rebalance, and scaling
- `Controller` does not execute business runs directly

### Sandbox

- The isolated host environment where a worker runs
- May be a local process, a dedicated Pod, a container, or a future VM / remote executor
- `Sandbox` describes the execution environment; it does not replace `Worker` as the primary term
- With the `embedded` provider there is no separate sandbox process; the worker runs directly inside `oah-api`
- With `self_hosted / e2b`, the standalone worker must run inside a real sandbox

### Sandbox Host API

- The stable adapter boundary between the worker and its host environment
- The first implementation should be OAH's own sandbox pod
- The exposed provider vocabulary is `embedded | self_hosted | e2b`, and backend switching should be a server-config change rather than an API change
- It carries host lifecycle, file access, and process execution capabilities only; it does not redefine OAH ownership or control-plane semantics
- The formal `e2b` semantics now match the self-hosted path: host the standalone worker inside the real sandbox rather than driving E2B indirectly from an external worker

### Workspace

- A workspace is the logical project, capability-discovery, and session-ownership boundary
- It answers “which project and capability set is this agent working in?”, not “which host is it running on?”
- A workspace may be materialized into a worker-owned `Active Workspace Copy` for execution
- One sandbox may carry multiple active workspaces up to capacity; one active workspace should have exactly one owner worker holding its writable truth

### Workspace Ownership

- `workspace -> owner worker` is the routing truth for execution and file access
- `ownerId` is the affinity scheduling key, not a separate ownership truth beyond `workspace -> owner worker`
- While active, a workspace's read/write truth lives in the owner worker's `Active Workspace Copy`; after idle flush, truth returns to OSS / external storage

### Layering Rule

Use these two chains together:

`Agent Engine -> Worker -> Sandbox -> Active Workspace Copy`

`Agent Engine -> Workspace -> Session -> Run`

In other words:

- `workspace` is the logical project and capability boundary
- `sandbox` is the execution-host and file/process isolation boundary
- `worker` is the execution role running inside that host
- active workspaces are materialized into sandbox-local copies
- `runtime` initializes a workspace but does not replace workspace / sandbox / worker as a concept

## 5. Core Modules

### API Server

- Provides OpenAPI endpoints and SSE event streams
- Receives / validates caller context from upstream
- Handles access control, rate limiting, parameter validation, and metadata persistence
- Creates workspaces, sessions, messages, and runs
- Resolves workspace ownership and routes run / file requests to the owner worker
- Default mode includes an embedded worker; `api-only` mode handles ingress and routing only

### Worker

- Reuses `packages/engine-core` for business execution logic
- Consumes runs and drives the model <-> tool loop
- Enforces per-session serial execution
- Manages cancellation, timeout, and failure recovery
- Owns workspace materialization, local file access, and flush / evict
- Can run embedded inside the API Server or standalone in a dedicated Pod

### Controller

- Owns workspace placement and worker lifecycle governance
- Combines `owner affinity + workspace ownership + worker health + capacity` into placement decisions
- For `self_hosted / e2b` providers, also derives logical sandbox fleet demand: the same `ownerId` reuses a sandbox, while ownerless workspaces use a shared pool, first reusing existing sandboxes whose CPU, memory, and disk are below threshold and then falling back to a warm empty sandbox when any resource crosses the threshold
- Owns drain, rebalance, recovery, and scaling
- Does not execute business runs directly

### Sandbox Host API

- Unifies the host capabilities a worker depends on
- It should cover only:
  - sandbox / session creation and reuse
  - workspace materialization / mount
  - file read / write / download
  - command execution / process management
  - health, drain, and shutdown
- The current target is "compatible switching" with E2B, not reshaping OAH around E2B's full native resource model first

### Engine Core

- Loads workspace config: `AGENTS.md`, `settings.yaml`, agents, models
- Loads platform-level model / tool / skill directories
- Assembles system prompt, history messages, and capability catalog
- `project` workspace: loads all capability types
- workspace: loads agents / models / AGENTS.md together with declared actions / skills / tools / hooks
- Owns the run state machine, session-serial boundaries, tool loop, audit, and recovery closure

### Invocation Dispatcher

- Maps tool call names back to source (native / action / skill / external)
- Routes to the appropriate executor
- Wraps parameter parsing, audit, timeout, and result propagation

### Execution Backend

- Unified workspace execution environment (shell, file I/O, process management)
- Abstracts local execution, self-hosted sandbox pods, and future E2B-like host backends
- workspaces always create backend sessions and run through the same execution path

### Hook Runtime

- Executes lifecycle hooks (run events) and interceptor hooks (tool / model events)
- Allows controlled modification of requests and execution logic within safety bounds

## 6. Recommended Deployment Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `oah-api` + embedded worker | Smallest deployment. One API process directly hosts the embedded worker. |
| `oah-api` + `oah-controller` + `oah-sandbox` | Preferred main mode. `oah-api` handles ingress, `oah-controller` handles the control plane, and `oah-sandbox` hosts the standalone worker. |
| Standalone worker in sandbox | The typical standalone-worker deployment shape. The worker runs inside a self-hosted sandbox or an E2B sandbox. |
| `oah-api` + `oah-controller` + E2B sandbox | Remote sandbox form. The standalone worker runs inside a real E2B sandbox while API and control-plane semantics stay the same. |

## 8. Key Architecture Decisions

- No built-in user system -- consumes external identity and access context
- Workspace is the configuration and capability discovery boundary; `.openharness/settings.yaml` is the entry point
- Platform built-in agents merge with workspace agents; workspace agents override on name collision
- Runtimes are for initialization only -- runtime reads current workspace files
- workspaces are managed under `workspace_dir`; runtimes are only initialization sources
- `AGENTS.md` is injected verbatim (no summarization)
- Agents defined via `agents/*.md` -- frontmatter for config, body for system prompt
- Model / Hook / Tool Server configs use declarative YAML
- Actions use `actions/*/ACTION.yaml`; Skills use `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- All capabilities are unified as tool calling for the LLM, but stay separate in domain and governance
- `Worker` is the unified execution role; `sandbox` is only the worker host environment, not the primary runtime term
- `Sandbox Host API` is the host compatibility boundary; the first implementation should be the self-hosted sandbox pod, with E2B as a later pluggable backend rather than the primary architecture vocabulary
- `Controller` is the unified control-plane role; it owns placement, lifecycle, and capacity rather than direct business execution
- For remote sandbox providers, the controller owns both logical sandbox-fleet sizing and scale-target reconciliation; the local Compose stack applies that through `oah-compose-scaler`, while Kubernetes applies it through workload `/scale`, currently supporting `Deployment` and `StatefulSet`
- `workspace -> owner worker` is the routing truth for execution and file access; `ownerId` is used for affinity scheduling and must not be treated as a second ownership source of truth
- While active, a workspace's read/write truth lives in the owner worker's `Active Workspace Copy`; after flush / evict, truth returns to OSS / external storage
- Default trusted intranet environment -- no strong container isolation by default; if the platform is exposed more broadly, sandbox backend hardening should be prioritized
- PostgreSQL is the central source of truth; local workspace state files do not serve as a cross-process sync mechanism
