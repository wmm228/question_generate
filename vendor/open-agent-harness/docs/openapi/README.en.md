# API Reference

The HTTP API is built on REST resource endpoints + SSE event streams. The [openapi.yaml](./openapi.yaml) file is the authoritative interface definition.

## Conventions

- Public API: `/api/v1`
- Internal model runtime: `/internal/v1/models/*` (loopback only, no `Authorization`)
- Host can inject a caller context resolver; without one, standalone server uses minimal caller context
- Async entry points (send message, trigger action) return `202`
- Streaming uses SSE
- Final execution status determined by the run resource
- Sending a session message is non-interrupting by default; pass `runningRunBehavior: "interrupt"` if you want the new message to cancel the current active run first
- The follow-up message queue is a server-side resource. Read it with `GET /sessions/{id}/queue`, and promote an already queued message with `POST /runs/{id}/guide`

Key boundaries: `session` = context boundary, `run` = execution boundary, runs within a session are serial.

File and command endpoints intentionally keep [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B)-style sandbox semantics: routes live under `/sandboxes`, and sandbox roots are exposed as `/workspace`. This is a stable interface contract, not a temporary compatibility layer. The `/workspaces` API still remains for workspace metadata, catalog, and lifecycle concerns.

## Start Here

- Overall API shape: endpoint tables below
- Concrete schema: [openapi.yaml](./openapi.yaml)
- Message sending + execution: read [sessions.md](./sessions.md), [runs.md](./runs.md), [streaming.md](./streaming.md) together
- File management: [files.md](./files.md)
