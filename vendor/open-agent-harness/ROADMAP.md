# OAH Controller / Worker Architecture Roadmap

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap captures the current architecture direction after the `controller` naming and control-plane unification work.

It is not only a rename log. It records the design shifts that now define the next stage of OAH:

- `API Server + Worker + Controller` becomes the formal production topology
- `Worker` stays the unified execution role
- `Controller` expands from simple replica scaling into placement and lifecycle governance
- `sandbox` is treated as the worker host environment, not as a replacement runtime role
- sandbox host capabilities should be exposed behind a stable adapter boundary so self-hosted pods and E2B-like backends can both fit
- `workspace ownership` remains the routing and file-access truth boundary

## 2. What Changed Beyond Naming

### 2.1 Control Plane Scope Expanded

Previously the control plane was often framed as a narrow worker-scaling component:

- worker replica scaling
- queue pressure observation
- leader election

The current accepted model is broader:

- workspace placement
- user-affinity aware scheduling
- worker / pod lifecycle governance
- drain / recovery / rebalance
- capacity-aware scaling

So the real change is:

- from `replica scaler`
- to `control plane`

### 2.2 Worker Is Now Clearly the Execution Role

The current architecture explicitly fixes:

- `Worker` is the execution runtime role
- `Worker` can be embedded inside `API Server`
- `Worker` can run standalone in its own pod
- future sandbox pods are only a host/isolation shape for workers

This keeps one execution core across:

- local development
- embedded mode
- split production mode
- future sandbox-backed mode

### 2.3 Sandbox Is No Longer the Primary Domain Term

We are intentionally not redefining the whole system around `sandbox`.

The preferred interpretation is:

- `sandbox` = host environment / isolation boundary
- `worker` = execution role
- `controller` = control plane role

This avoids coupling core architecture to one backend shape too early.

### 2.4 Self-Hosted Sandbox Pod Comes Before Native E2B Adoption

The accepted implementation order is:

- first keep OAH's own sandbox pod shape as the production execution host
- then align the host-facing adapter boundary with the subset of E2B-style lifecycle and file APIs we actually need
- only after that consider a real E2B-backed host adapter

This means:

- we are optimizing for compatibility, not immediate replacement
- we do not want current control-plane, ownership, or OSS semantics to depend on E2B-specific resource models
- the self-hosted sandbox pod remains the reference implementation for worker hosting

### 2.5 Host Compatibility Is An Adapter Concern

The preferred split is:

- `Worker` remains the execution role and business runtime
- `sandbox host` provides process / filesystem / lifecycle isolation
- `Sandbox Host API` is the compatibility boundary

That boundary should cover only what OAH really needs:

- sandbox/session creation and reuse
- workspace mount / materialization
- file read / write / download
- command / process execution
- liveness / readiness / drain / termination

It should not force the rest of OAH to inherit:

- E2B naming as the primary domain language
- E2B-specific persistence assumptions
- per-sandbox truth semantics that conflict with `workspace -> owner worker`

### 2.6 Workspace Ownership Remains the Truth Boundary

The current roadmap keeps:

- `workspace -> owner worker` as routing truth
- active workspace read/write truth on the owner worker `Active Workspace Copy`
- idle flush / eviction returning truth to OSS

This means we are not moving to:

- `owner -> pod` as ownership truth
- shared multi-writer workspace truth
- cross-pod live sync as the main model

### 2.7 Owner Affinity Is a Placement Hint, Not Ownership

`ownerId` is now treated as:

- placement affinity key
- warm-cache reuse hint
- capacity / quota dimension

But not:

- the execution truth key
- a guarantee that one owner maps to exactly one pod

The accepted policy is:

- same-owner workspaces should prefer the same worker / pod
- but may spill to another worker when capacity, disk, drain, or health requires it

### 2.8 Controller Becomes the Future Home of Placement Logic

The long-term split is now:

- `API Server`: ingress, auth context, metadata persistence, owner routing
- `Worker`: execution, materialization, file access, run lifecycle
- `Controller`: placement, lifecycle, capacity, rebalance, scale

This is the main architectural shift beyond terminology.

## 3. Naming End State

The codebase now uses `controller` as the only primary control-plane name:

- `apps/controller/`
- `@oah/controller`
- `OAH_CONTROLLER_*`
- `oah_controller_*`
- `deploy/kubernetes/controller.yaml`
- `deploy/controller-servicemonitor.yaml`
- Helm `controller.*` values

## 4. Target Architecture

### 4.1 Production Topology

- `API Server`
- `Worker`
- `Controller`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Redis`
- `OSS / Object Storage`

### 4.2 Responsibility Split

`API Server`

- external API
- SSE
- caller context
- metadata persistence
- owner lookup and proxying

`Worker`

- engine-core execution
- session-serial boundaries
- workspace materialization
- local file access
- idle flush / eviction
- run recovery closure

`Controller`

- worker placement policy
- owner affinity policy
- health / drain aware scaling
- rebalance and recovery decisions

`Sandbox Host API`

- worker host lifecycle abstraction
- self-hosted sandbox pod reference implementation
- future E2B-compatible adapter boundary
- no change to worker execution semantics

## 5. Delivery Phases

### Phase A: Naming And Topology Unification

- rename formal package/runtime identity to `controller`
- update logs, manifests, chart resource names, and docs
- remove legacy control-plane path and file names
- remove legacy control-plane aliases

Status:

- done

### Phase B: Placement-Aware Controller

- move controller narrative from replica scaler to placement control plane
- define worker selection inputs:
  - owner affinity
  - workspace ownership
  - current worker health
  - capacity
  - drain state
- keep actual execution in workers

Status:

- done

Implemented so far:

- controller snapshots now expose first-class placement summaries rather than only replica counts
- controller now distinguishes placement ownership on healthy / late / missing workers
- controller scale-down is blocked while placement ownership is still unstable
- controller now emits placement policy signals covering:
  - unassigned workspaces
  - missing / late / draining owner workers
  - owners spanning multiple workers
  - workers whose placement ref-load exceeds the soft slots-per-pod capacity
- controller can now surface `placement_attention` even when replica count stays steady, so placement governance is no longer invisible behind scale-only reasons
- controller snapshots now also emit structured placement recommendations such as:
  - assign unassigned workspaces
  - recover missing owners
  - reassign late owners
  - finish draining owners
  - consolidate owner affinity
  - rebalance workers above soft placement capacity
- placement recommendations now include representative workspace / worker / owner samples so the control plane output can feed concrete rebalance and recovery workflows later
- controller now emits a placement action-plan shape on top of recommendations, including:
  - execution phase (`stabilize` / `handoff` / `optimize`)
  - blocker type
  - next suggested item
  - concrete workspace / worker / owner scopes for follow-up
- controller now also derives machine-actionable placement execution operations from live placement state, rather than stopping at descriptive recommendations
- an optional placement executor can now perform the first safe ownership-handoff actions:
  - release placements that still point to missing owners
  - release placements on draining / stopping owners
  - release idle placements on late owners while skipping still-active workspaces
- controller snapshots and metrics now expose placement execution results (`attempted` / `applied` / `skipped` / `failed`) so remediation is observable
- controller runtime wiring now supports enabling these placement actions explicitly via `OAH_CONTROLLER_PLACEMENT_ACTIONS_ENABLED`
- controller placement execution now also selects concrete target workers using the same core inputs the rest of OAH uses:
  - worker health
  - drain state
  - workspace affinity
  - owner affinity
  - soft-capacity pressure
- placement state can now persist controller handoff hints via `preferredWorkerId`, so reassignment is no longer just "drop ownership and hope"
- unassigned workspaces, late owners, user-affinity splits, and soft-capacity hot spots can now all produce target-worker hints instead of only descriptive recommendations
- Redis worker affinity summaries and storage admin inspection now surface controller-target reasons directly, making placement handoff visible outside the controller loop

### Phase C: Workspace Placement State

- introduce first-class placement state for:
  - `workspaceId`
  - `ownerId`
  - `ownerWorkerId`
  - `ownerBaseUrl`
  - capacity / lifecycle metadata
- keep ownership truth at workspace level

Status:

- done

Implemented so far:

- Redis `workspace placement registry` now exists as a first-class state store, separate from transient workspace ownership leases
- materialized workspace lifecycle now publishes placement state transitions such as `active` / `idle` / `draining` / `evicted`
- workspace creation/import can seed `ownerId` into placement state
- storage admin now exposes workspace placement snapshots for inspection
- worker affinity inspection now derives `same_owner` preference from workspace placement state, so sibling workspaces for the same owner can prefer a warm worker without changing workspace ownership truth
- controller snapshots and metrics now distinguish placements on healthy / late / missing owner workers, and controller scale-down is blocked while placement ownership is still unstable
- workspace placement inspection now supports filtering by `workspaceId`, `ownerId`, `ownerWorkerId`, and `state`, making placement state usable for control-plane debugging and future placement workflows

### Phase D: Sandbox-Backed Worker Hosts

- define a stable sandbox host adapter boundary
- keep self-hosted sandbox pods as the first production backend
- keep worker execution semantics unchanged
- treat sandbox as host environment only

Status:

- done

Implemented so far:

- `engine-core` now carries a first-class `SandboxHost` contract alongside the existing execution / file-access provider seam
- the shared host contract now includes:
  - provider kind (`embedded` / `self_hosted` / `e2b`)
  - workspace command execution
  - workspace file access
  - workspace execution lease acquisition
  - host diagnostics
  - host maintenance / drain / close lifecycle
- the materialization-backed worker host is now the first concrete implementation of that contract
- `api-server` bootstrap now treats sandbox host bindings as a single host surface instead of an ad-hoc group of separate runtime injections
- worker execution semantics remain unchanged:
  - `workspace -> owner worker` is still the truth boundary
  - materialization-backed local copies are still the active read/write truth while mounted on the owner worker
  - drain / idle flush / idle eviction semantics are unchanged

### Phase E: E2B-Compatible Host Adapter

- align the sandbox host API with the E2B subset OAH actually needs
- preserve OAH ownership, routing, and OSS semantics
- keep E2B as an optional backend, not the primary architecture vocabulary

Status:

- done

Implemented so far:

- server bootstrap now accepts an injected sandbox host factory, so non-self-hosted backends can plug in without rewriting runtime bootstrap
- a first `createE2BCompatibleSandboxHost(...)` adapter now exists for bridging an E2B-style remote sandbox service into OAH's `SandboxHost` contract
- that adapter now covers the OAH subset we actually need:
  - execution lease acquisition
  - file-access lease acquisition
  - foreground / process / background command execution
  - file stat / read / readdir / mkdir / write / rm / rename
  - diagnostics / maintain / beginDrain / close lifecycle
- the adapter uses a virtual sandbox path boundary so engine-core and server code can keep using normal workspace path semantics while the backend remains remote
- E2B compatibility remains optional and adapter-scoped:
  - `embedded` remains the local materialization backend
  - `self_hosted` remains the remote self-hosted sandbox backend
  - bootstrap injection is the extension point
  - ownership truth and OSS semantics remain unchanged

### Phase F: Sandbox Fleet Signals

- make sandbox fleet demand a first-class controller concern
- keep worker execution and sandbox hosting as separate layers
- derive sandbox grouping from `ownerId` affinity instead of inventing a new API surface
- prepare for future sandbox autoscaling targets without forcing one backend today

Status:

- in progress

Implemented so far:

- server config now exposes `sandbox.fleet.*` for remote sandbox capacity hints:
  - `min_count`
  - `max_count`
  - `max_workspaces_per_sandbox`
  - `ownerless_pool`
- controller now resolves a first-class `SandboxFleetConfig` from `embedded | self_hosted | e2b`
- controller snapshots now include `sandboxFleet`, which derives:
  - owner-scoped workspace counts
  - ownerless workspace counts
  - logical sandbox demand
  - bounded desired sandbox count
  - whether fleet demand is capped by configured max capacity
- controller metrics now expose sandbox fleet signals so `self_hosted` / `e2b` rollouts can observe real demand before attaching a concrete autoscaling target

Still remaining:

1. add a real sandbox registry / observed active sandbox inventory instead of logical demand only
2. attach `sandboxFleet.desiredSandboxes` to a concrete scaling target for self-hosted sandbox deployments
3. add an E2B-native control path for sandbox lifecycle reuse / warm-pool management

## 6. Completion Audit

Current state:

- `Phase A-E` are implemented at the architecture / contract layer.
- `Phase F` has started with real controller/config/metrics wiring, but does not yet own concrete sandbox scaling actions.
- placement hints already feed real runtime queueing paths via `preferredWorkerId`, not only storage/admin inspection.
- worker ownership, sticky routing, self-hosted default backend, and adapter-scoped E2B compatibility remain intact.

The main remaining follow-up is:

1. Add a production-grade sandbox fleet control path:
   - real remote sandbox inventory / registry
   - self-hosted sandbox autoscaling target
   - native E2B lifecycle adapter behind the same contract

That means this roadmap is largely complete at the contract level, but not fully closed if the goal is "controller-managed sandbox fleet that can switch seamlessly between self_hosted and e2b in production".

## 7. Non-Goals Right Now

- replacing `worker` with `sandbox` as the primary runtime term
- moving ownership truth from workspace to user
- introducing multi-writer live workspace sync between pods
- removing embedded worker mode
- rebuilding OAH directly around the full E2B resource model
- forcing a breaking config migration in one step
